# HexenRPG
Gameplay mod for Hexen: Beyond Heretic running on the (G)Zdoom engine that brings forth Diablo II and other RPG influences to make it a more palatable experience for modern players.

Name recommendations are very much welcome. 

Current proposals (More or less inspired by Diablo II's format and yet still remaining distinct from already existing mod Wrath of Cronos) include: 
- HexenRPG: Lord of Cronos (give or take the RPG)
- Korax: Lord of Cronos
