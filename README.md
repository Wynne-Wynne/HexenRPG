# HexenRPG
Gameplay modfication for _Hexen: Beyond Heretic_ running on the **(G)Zdoom** engine that brings forth _Diablo II_ and other RPG influences to make it a more palatable experience for modern players.

Name recommendations are very much welcome. 

Current proposals (More or less inspired by _Diablo II_'s format and yet still remaining distinct from already existing mod _Wrath of Cronos_) include: 
- **HexenRPG: Lord of Cronos** (give or take the RPG)
- **Korax: Lord of Cronos**
